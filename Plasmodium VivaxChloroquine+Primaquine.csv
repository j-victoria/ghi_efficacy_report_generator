Antimalarial activities of various 4-quinolonemethanols with special attention to WR-142,490 (mefloquine).  Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Antimalarial activities of various 4-quinolonemethanols with special attention to WR-142,490 (mefloquine).  Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen.

Antimalarial activities of various 4-quinolonemethanols with special attention to WR-142,490 (mefloquine).  Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Antimalarial activities of various 4-quinolonemethanols with special attention to WR-142,490 (mefloquine).  Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."

Efficacy of 5-day radical treatment of P. vivax infection in Tamil Nadu.",0," Chloroquine, in combination with primaquine, is used as the firstline treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria in Thailand. In view of the declining efficacy of chloroquine in many P. vivax endemic areas, the possibility of emergence of chloroquine- resistant P. vivax in Thailand is a concern. The aim of this study was to assess the trends in therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine and primaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and to assess the utility of parasite clearance times as a measure of efficacy.  This study consisted of: 1) review of medical records of patients who were hospitalised for a period during their treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Bangkok, Thailand between 2004 and 2013. Treatment consisted of chloroquine (1500 mg base administered over 3 days) or chloroquine (as before) plus primaquine (15 to 30 mg base/daily for 14 days from day 2); and 2) systematic review of the literature in English to assess current standards in the reporting of parasite clearance times.  The 28-day cure rate was 99.1%. The range of median parasite clearance time over the 10-year period was 46 to 59 hours, and there was statistical evidence for an increasing trend in parasite clearance times between 2009 and 2013. Heterogeneity was noted among previous chloroquine efficacy studies in the measurement and reporting of parasite clearance.  The treatment of P. vivax infection with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine has remained efficacious in Thailand. Increasing rates of parasite clearance in a population over time may be a useful early warning mechanism for the emergence of chloroquine resistance. The utility of monitoring time-trends in parasite clearance to detect resistance may be enhanced if parasite clearance measurements are standardised.  To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by P. vivax.  A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by P. vivax of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated.  For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found.  Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of P. vivax. Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.  Comparar la eficacia y seguridad de los esquemas de primaquina actualmente usados para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de malaria por P. vivax.  A trav&#xE9;s de una revisi&#xF3;n sistem&#xE1;tica se identificaron ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que evaluaran la eficacia y seguridad para prevenir recurrencias por P. vivax del r&#xE9;gimen de primaquina 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 7 o 14 d&#xED;as comparado al r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar de 0.25 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a por 14 d&#xED;as. Se determin&#xF3; la eficacia de primaquina con la incidencia acumulada de recurrencias posterior a 28 d&#xED;as. Se estim&#xF3; el riesgo relativo global con un meta-an&#xE1;lisis de efectos fijos.  Se identificaron 7 ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para el r&#xE9;gimen 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/7 d&#xED;as que mostraron una incidencia de recurrencias entre 0% y 20% con un seguimiento de 60 a 210 d&#xED;as; solo 4 estudios compararon con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar y no se encontraron diferencias en las recurrencias entre ambos esquemas (RR= 0.977; IC 95%= 0.670-1.423). Se identificaron tres ensayos cl&#xED;nicos que usaron el esquema 0.5 mg/Kg/d&#xED;a/14 d&#xED;as con una incidencia de recurrencias entre 1.8% y 18.0% para 330 a 365 d&#xED;as; solo un estudio compar&#xF3; con el r&#xE9;gimen est&#xE1;ndar (RR= 0.846; IC 95%= 0.484-1.477). Se encontr&#xF3; alto riesgo de sesgo y diferencias en la conducci&#xF3;n de los estudios incluidos.  No hay suficiente evidencia para determinar si los reg&#xED;menes de primaquina usados como alternativas al tratamiento est&#xE1;ndar tienen mejor eficacia para prevenir las reca&#xED;das de P. vivax. Se requieren ensayos cl&#xED;nicos para orientar los cambios en el esquema de tratamiento de este tipo de malaria.  Prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of P. vivax genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous P. vivax infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of P. vivax infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of P. vivax infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of P. vivax infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of P. vivax infection relapse.  NCT01376167.  Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium vivax malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection.  A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection P. vivax malaria as per the World Health Organization's protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks.  Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia.  CQ-PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.  Chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) continues to be the frontline therapy for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria. Emergence of CQ-resistant (CQR) P. vivax parasites requires a shift to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which imposes a significant financial, logistical, and safety burden. Monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of CQ is thus important. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of CQ-PQ for P. vivax malaria in northeast Myanmar. We recruited 587 patients with P. vivax monoinfection attending local malaria clinics during 2012 to 2013. These patients received three daily doses of CQ at a total dose of 24 mg of base/kg of body weight and an 8-day PQ treatment (0.375 mg/kg/day) commencing at the same time as the first CQ dose. Of the 401 patients who finished the 28-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent parasitemia was 5.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.04% to 7.36%). Among 361 (61%) patients finishing a 42-day follow-up, the cumulative incidence of recurrent blood-stage infection reached 7.98% (95% CI, 5.20% to 10.76%). The cumulative risk of gametocyte carriage at days 28 and 42 was 2.21% (95% CI, 0.78% to 3.64%) and 3.93% (95% CI, 1.94% to 5.92%), respectively. Interestingly, for all 15 patients with recurrent gametocytemia, this was associated with concurrent asexual stages. Genotyping of recurrent parasites at the merozoite surface protein 3&#x3B1; gene locus from 12 patients with recurrent parasitemia within 28 days revealed that 10 of these were the same genotype as at day 0, suggesting recrudescence or relapse. Similar studies in 70 patients in the same area in 2007 showed no recurrent parasitemias within 28 days. The sensitivity to chloroquine of P. vivax in northeastern Myanmar may be deteriorating.  In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development of Plasmodium resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.  We evaluated the efficacy of three primaquine (PQ) regimes to prevent relapses with Plasmodium vivax through an open-label randomized trial in Loreto, Peru. Vivax monoinfections were treated with chloroquine for 3 days and PQ in three different regimes: 0.5 mg/kg per day for 5 days (150 mg total), 0.5 mg/kg per day for 7 days (210 mg total), or 0.25 mg/kg per day for 14 days (210 mg total). Biweekly fever assessments and bimonthly thick smears were taken for 210 days. Recurrences after 35 days were considered relapses. One hundred eighty cases were enrolled in each group; 90% of cases completed follow-up. There were no group-related differences in age, sex, or parasitemia. Relapse rates were similar in the 7- and 14-day regimes (16/156 = 10.3% and 22/162 = 13.6%, P = 0.361) and higher in the 5-day group (48/169 = 28.4%, P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). The 7-day PQ regimen used in Peru is as efficacious as the recommended 14-day regimen and superior to 5 treatment days.  Plasmodium vivax is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China.  An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of P. vivax were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson's test.  By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild.  ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.  In vivo efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for Plasmodium vivax in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used.  In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for P. vivax in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with P. vivax monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8-82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6-94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent P. vivax infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1-95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6-99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml.  In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for P. vivax malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of P. vivax malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01052584.  In central China, Plasmodium vivax accounts for all of the native reported cases of malaria. Chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine (PQ) have been used for more than 60 years as the frontline drugs, but the risk of treatment failure remains unknown. To measure the effectiveness and safety of CQ-PQ among vivax malaria patients, a total of 39 subjects with monoinfection vivax malaria was enrolled in a study from 2008 to 2009. There were no recrudescence or danger signs observed within the 28-day follow-up period, showing that blood stage of P. vivax isolates from central China is still susceptible to CQ plus PQ combination therapy. However, the antirelapse efficacy of PQ is difficult to assess because of the high rate of loss to follow-up after 28 days; also, parasites persisted in a single case at 3 days post-antimalarial drug treatment, indicating that continuous annual monitoring is needed in central China.  Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).  Chloroquine (CQ), followed by 14 - day primaquine, is the recommended regimen for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax infection in Thailand. CQ resistant P. vivax (CRPv) has not yet challenged the efficacy of the drug. The present study was conducted to assess the current response of P. vivax to CQ alone in Thailand.  A 28-day in vivo therapeutic efficacy study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2010 in 4 sentinel sites. Recurrence of parasitaemia and the clinical condition of patients were assessed on each visit during follow -up. The drug levels in recurrent patients' blood were measured using HPLC. Data were analyzed using the WHO 2008 program for the analysis of in vivo tests.  Of the total 212 patients included in the study, 201 completed the 28-days follow- up, while 11 were excluded. In five patients (2.5%), parasitaemia reappeared within the 28-days follow - up. On the day of recurrent parasitaemia, the level of chloroquine/desethylchloroquine (CQ - DCQ) was above the minimum effective concentration (&gt;100 ng/ml) in one patient, but lower in four patients.  Reappearance of the parasite within 28 days of follow - up in one of five patients was due to parasite resistance to CQ. The 2.5% prevalence of CQ treatment failure for P. vivax malaria in the study areas signals the need to launch monitoring activities for CQ resistant P. vivax in malaria endemic areas in order to detect further development of parasite resistance and to estimate the level of burden across the country.  Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax. This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.  Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.  In Thailand, the proportion of Plasmodium vivax infection has become equal to Plasmodium falciparum. Reports of a trend of gradual decline of in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance P. vivax in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with in vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates.  The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008-August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of P. vivax malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days). In vitro sensitivity of P. vivax isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay.  All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of P. vivax parasitaemia nor appearance of P. falciparum occurred during the investigation period. In vitro data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC50 for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively.  In vivo results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with P. vivax in the Thai-Myanmar border area. In vitro sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of P. vivax is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.  A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.  Plasmodium vivax is the second most important cause of morbidity in Ethiopia. There is, however, little information on P. vivax resistance to chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment although these drugs have been used as the first line treatment for over 50 years. We assessed the efficacy of standard chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine treatment for P. vivax infections in a randomized open-label comparative study in Debre Zeit and Nazareth in East Shoa, Ethiopia. A total of 290 patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax malaria who presented to the outpatient settings of the two laboratory centers were enrolled: 145 patients were randomized to receive CQ and 145 to receive CQ+PQ treatment. Participants were followed-up for 28-157 days according to the WHO procedures. There were 12 (6.5%) lost to follow-up patients and 9 (3.1%) withdrawals. In all, 96% (277/290) of patients were analysed at day 28. Baseline characteristics were similar in all treatment groups. In all, 98.6% (275/277) of patients had cleared their parasitemia on day 3 with no difference in mean parasite clearance time between regimens (48.34+/-17.68, 50.67+/-15.70 h for the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively, P=0.25). The cumulative incidence of therapeutic failure at day 28 by a life-table analysis method was 5.76% (95% CI: 2.2-14.61) and 0.75% (95% CI: 0.11-5.2%) in the CQ and CQ+PQ group, respectively (P=0.19). The relapse rate was 8% (9/108) for the CQ group and 3% (4/132) for the comparison group (P=0.07). The cumulative risk of relapse at day 157 by a life-table method was 61.8% (95% CI: 20.1-98.4%) in the CQ group, compared with 26.3% (95% CI: 7.5-29.4%) in the CQ+PQ group (P=0.0038). The study confirms the emergence of CQ and PQ resistance/treatment failure in P. vivax malaria in Ethiopia. Although treatment failures were detected, they were similar between the treatment groups. We recommend regular monitoring and periodic evaluation of the efficacy of these antimalarial drugs in systematically selected sentinel sites to detect further development of resistance and to make timely national antimalarial drug policy changes.  The gravity of the threat posed by vivax malaria to public health has been poorly appreciated. The widely held misperception of Plasmodium vivax as being relatively infrequent, benign, and easily treated explains its nearly complete neglect across the range of biological and clinical research. Recent evidence suggests a far higher and more-severe disease burden imposed by increasingly drug-resistant parasites. The two frontline therapies against vivax malaria, chloroquine and primaquine, may be failing. Despite 60 years of nearly continuous use of these drugs, their respective mechanisms of activity, resistance, and toxicity remain unknown. Although standardized means of assessing therapeutic efficacy against blood and liver stages have not been developed, this review examines the provisional in vivo, ex vivo, and animal model systems for doing so. The rationale, design, and interpretation of clinical trials of therapies for vivax malaria are discussed in the context of the nuance and ambiguity imposed by the hypnozoite. Fielding new drug therapies against real-world vivax malaria may require a reworking of the strategic framework of drug development, namely, the conception, testing, and evaluation of sets of drugs designed for the cure of both blood and liver asexual stages as well as the sexual blood stages within a single therapeutic regimen.  Plasmodium vivax infects 130-435 million of the 2.6 billion people living at risk of infection. Recent studies suggest that vivax malaria can become lethal in a similar way to severe falciparum malaria. First-line therapies remain unchanged after 50 years. Despite evidence of failing chloroquine efficacy, little work has assessed the problem or explored alternative therapies. Primaquine treatment, the only therapeutic option against relapse, might also be failing. No licensed primary chemoprophylactic agent protects travelers from relapse. Misdiagnosis of species now affects clinical decisions resulting in inadequate therapy for P. falciparum and P. vivax. All of these factors demonstrate the lack of research on P. vivax.  Chloroquine remains the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand. Mixed infections of falciparum and vivax malaria are also common in South-East Asia. Laboratory confirmation of malaria species is not generally available. This study aimed to find alternative regimens for treating both malaria species by using falciparum antimalarial drugs. From June 2004 to May 2005, 98 patients with Plasmodium vivax were randomly treated with either artemether-lumefantrine (n = 47) or chloroquine (n = 51). Both treatments were followed by 15 mg of primaquine over 14 days. Adverse events and clinical and parasitological outcomes were recorded and revealed similar in both groups. The cure rate was 97.4% for the artemether-lumefantrine treated group and 100% for the chloroquine treated group. We concluded that the combination of artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine was well tolerated, as effective as chloroquine and primaquine, and can be an alternative regimen for treatment of vivax malaria especially in the event that a mixed infection of falciparum and vivax malaria could not be ruled out.  Our previous study showed that in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has significantly decreased in Thailand within the past two decades. Thus, the evaluation of alternative antimalarials for treatment of vivax malaria is needed. The aim of this study was to examine parasitological and clinical efficacy of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) for the treatment of vivax malaria in patients who were admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. We randomly allocated patients aged 12-56 years to receive 3.3mg/kg (adult dose 200 mg) on the first day, and for the next four days each patient was given 1.65 mg/kg orally (adult dose 100 mg), total dose = 600 mg. After the five-day course of artesunate, primaquine was given: a single oral dose of 15mg for 14 days. A total number of 42 patients received treatment. All participants were followed up for 28 days. In all the cases, both parasitemia and fever were resolved rapidly; the mean fever clearance time and parasite clearance time, 14.6 and 36.7 hours, respectively, showed that therapeutic response to artesunate was better than that of chloroquine. The 14-day cure rate was 100%, but reappearance of parasitemia was seen in two patients on days 21 and 25 following treatment, respectively. These two cases of failure rate should be considered as true relapse rather than recrudescence, since the relapse interval in Southeast Asian vivax malaria according to recent findings seems to be 3 weeks after start of treatment, if primaquine is not given or an inadequate amount is given. In conclusion, artesunate might be useful in treatment of vivax malaria, causing a good blood schizontocidal effect. However, to prevent emerging resistance it should never be used alone.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been reported in some Asian countries. In 2003, 161 patients infected with vivax malaria were treated according to the Thai National Drug Policy, with oral chloroquine (approximately 25 mg base/kg body weight, administered over 3 days) followed by primaquine on day 28 (15 mg daily for 14 days). All the patients were initially cured after chloroquine treatment, clearing their parasitemias within 7 days. Only one patient presented with parasitemia at 28 days. These data indicate that chloroquine is still effective for the treatment of patients with vivax malaria in Thailand.  Efficacy of chloroquine followed by primaquine has been monitored in 153 patients in seven districts of Azerbaijan. Chloroquine is fully effective over the first 14 days and the combination of chloroquine and primaquine is 100% effective over 28 days.  For over 4 decades the antimalarial program in India has been prescribing a 5-day primaquine regimen as an antirelapse therapy to treat Plasmodium vivax malaria. In view of conflicting reports on the effectiveness of this regimen in the Indian subcontinent, and the varying prevalence of P. vivax in various ecosystems in India, the antirelapse efficacy of this regimen was evaluated in Orissa, a malaria endemic state in eastern India where P. falciparum predominates. In 723 cases of P. vivax infection treated with chloroquine alone and followed up weekly for 1 yr, the prevalence of recurrence of parasitaemia with fever was 8.6%. Among another 759 P. vivax cases treated with chloroquine and a 5-day regimen of primaquine at 15 mg/day (adult dose), the recurrence of infection was 6.5%. The difference in recurrence was not significant (P = 0.53). It is important to note that in a great majority of cases of P. vivax in this area, infection did not recur even without treatment with primaquine. This finding, that the use of the 5-day primaquine regimen with chloroquine had no significant advantage over the use of chloroquine alone, undermines the rationale of using primaquine as an antirelapse drug in forested areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum.  Following a recent, abrupt local increase in the incidence of vivax malaria, a study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of 26 adult patients with acute vivax malaria in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. The chloroquine sensitivity of Plasmodium vivax has been assessed in parallel, using a growth inhibition method. Blood samples for the in vitro tests were taken prior to the administration of the standard treatment with chloroquine--in total 25 mg base/kg over 3 days--and primaquine 0.25 mg base/kg once daily for 14 days. The efficacy has been assessed according to the WHO standard in vivo test. The cure rate was 100%. No recrudescence was observed during the follow-up period of 28 days. The mean fever clearance time (FCT) was 40 h, the mean parasite clearance time (PCT) was 49 h. Mean IC(50) and IC(90) of the parasites were 28 and 171 nM, respectively. These results show that local P. vivax is still sensitive to chloroquine. The epidemic outbreak was therefore obviously not due to the presence of chloroquine-resistant P. vivax.  Chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax has been the subject of numerous case reports and prospective studies from Oceania and Asia. In contrast, only case reports exist from the Americas. We performed a prospective study with 28-day follow-up of clinical responses to chloroquine in 2 P. vivax-endemic regions of Colombia. Three (11%) of 27 patients failed to respond to treatment with the standard regimen of chloroquine (1,500 mg of base over 3 days). One patient demonstrated RI resistance on Day 26; one patient demonstrated RI resistance due to recrudescence of blood stages on Day 11; and one patient demonstrated RII resistance of blood stages by never displaying clearing of peripheral parasitemia. All patients were successfully treated with primaquine, which has some blood stage efficacy against P. vivax, combined with a second course of chloroquine. Clinical resistance of P. vivax to chloroquine is present in Colombia and should be monitored in the Americas.  The efficacy of chloroquine (25 mg base/kg over 3 days) in Plasmodium vivax malaria was evaluated in 1995/96 in 342 patients living in an endemic area on the western border of Thailand. Clearance of fever and parasites was obtained within 2 days in &gt; 95% of the patients, and all were aparasitaemic by day 4. Reappearance of P. vivax occurred in 1 patient on day 21 and in 8 by day 28, giving a 28-day cure rate of 97% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95-99%]. By day 63, the relapse/re-infection rate was 63% (95% CI 57-69%). Most reappearances of parasitaemia (85%; 121/143) were symptomatic. These patients were retreated either with chloroquine alone (n = 70) or with chloroquine and primaquine (0.25 mg/kg daily for 14 days) (n = 43). Only 1 patient (in the chloroquine-only group) had prolonged parasite clearance (D8) and he developed recurrent P. vivax by day 21 suggesting possible recrudescence. The addition of primaquine to chloroquine reduced the risk of having a third vivax episode within 2 months by 96% (95% CI 83-99%). This resulted in a significantly higher haematocrit at day 42 despite a greater decrease in haematocrit during the first week of treatment with chloroquine-primaquine (P = 0.04). Chloroquine remains highly effective on the western border of Thailand and the use of strictly supervised primaquine effectively prevents relapse. The introduction of primaquine on a large scale in an endemic area still requires a long-term risk-benefit assessment which must take into account potential toxicity, low compliance and reductions in the incidence and severity of P. falciparum infections by co-existent P. vivax.  Malaria prophylaxis for travelers is a controversial issue. The commonly used regimens are associated with side effects, low compliance, or low efficacy, which have raised concern regarding their use. In addition, they are inefficient against the tissue stage of the parasite and thus do not prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax infection. Primaquine is aimed at the pre-erythrocytic stage and thus may be a potential causal-prophylactic treatment that can abolish the need for long postexposure therapy. During 1995-1998, we followed retrospectively travelers who joined rafting trips to an area in Ethiopia where both P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum are hyperendemic. Of the 106 travelers who received primaquine, 5.7% developed malaria; of the 19 doxycycline recipients, 53% developed malaria; and of the 25 mefloquine recipients, 52% developed P. vivax malaria (&gt;/=3 months after return from the area of endemicity). Primaquine was well tolerated, and only 1 withdrawal from therapy (due to gastrointestinal symptoms) was reported. Primaquine was shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic drug against both P. falciparum malaria and P. vivax malaria in travelers.  Fifty patients with Plasmodium vivax infection were treated with the standard regimen of chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg over 3 d) followed by primaquine (45 mg immediately and then weekly for 8 weeks); 43 patients had sensitive infections but recrudescences of parasitaemia occurred between days 3 and 14 with RI, RII and RIII patterns in one, 3 and 3 patients, respectively. All the chloroquine-resistant cases were again treated with chloroquine (1500 mg) and no further recrudescence or relapse was detected on days 21 and 28. This study indicates that chloroquine is losing its efficacy against P. vivax in Myanmar.  We have analyzed the clinical data of 189 patients with malaria to establish antimalarial regimens in Japan. The causative parasite species were Plasmodium falciparum in 56 cases (30%), P. vivax in 132 (70%) and P. malariae in 1 (1%). The outcomes f malaria cases are as follows: Cure rats in falciparum and vivax malaria are 86% and 91%, respectively. Two patients died of falciparum malaria and recurrence occurred in 6 cases (11%) of falciparum malaria. Relapse was seen in 12 (9%) of vivax malaria. Chloroquine was most frequently used among antimalarial agents (in 123 cases, 65% of the total) for suppressing acute attacks. The efficacy of chloroquine was evaluated by classifying each case into three groups: chloroquine alone in group one, chloroquine in combination with other antimalarials in group two and other antimalarials except chloroquine in group three. The cure rate among each group is about 80% and there is no difference among them. However, it is noticeable that recurrence occurred when patients were treated with a combination of chloroquine and quinine. We have found a similar result as this in another old report in Japan. Primaquine is effective for eliminating hepatic tissue schizonts but in this study, relapse occurred in 12 cases of vivax, although primaquine had been used in 10 out of 12 cases. In primaquine group, relapse occurred at a similar rate between chloroquine and Fansidar cases. Further studies are needed to decide whether a larger dose of primaquine is appropriate for treatment of vivax malaria. Recovery periods from fever and parasitemia were compared between chloroquine and Fansidar cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)  Studies on 725 P. vivax infected patients at the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. produced 6.9 per cent relapse rate after administration of radical treatment of primaquine / 15 mg daily for 5 days as followed under the National Malaria Eradication Programme. Maximum relapses were recorded in a female patient in spite of repeated radical treatment.  Pilot appraisals of the activities of a selected group of 4-quinolinemethanols against acute Plasmodium falciparum infections in owl monkeys indicated that compounds of this class are equally active against infections with chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-susceptible strains and that this efficacy is not compromised by concomitant resistance to pyrimethamine, and in addition, identified three derivatives with outstanding activity (WR-226,253; WR-142,490; and WR-184,806). WR-142,490, the second 4-quinolinemethanol evaluated in the above model, was five times as active as chloroquine against infections with the chloroquine-susceptible, pyrimethamine-resistant strain and had a much larger therapeutic index. Expanded evaluations designed to support projected studies in human volunteers provided full confirmation of the pilot appraisals and in addition showed: (i) that the activity of WR-142,490 was a function of the total dose delivered, single doses being as effective as three or seven fractional doses administered over as many days; (ii) that intravenous administration of this agent was feasible and effective; and (iii) that the compound was at least as active against infections with P. vivax as against infections with P. falciparum. Companion studies in rhesus monkeys infected with P. cynomolgi showed that WR-142,490 lacked prophylactic or radical curative activity, but that it was as effective as chloroquine as a companion to primaquine in a combination curative drug regimen. The results of human volunteer and field trials agree well with comparable segments of these experimental evaluations."
