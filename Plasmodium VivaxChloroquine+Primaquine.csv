           Objective: 
            To compare efficacy and safety of primaquine regimens currently used to prevent relapses by  P. vivax. 
 
         
         
           Methods: 
            A systematic review was carried out to identify clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety to prevent malaria recurrences by  P. vivax  of primaquine regimen 0.5 mg/kg/ day for 7 or 14 days compared to standard regimen of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Efficacy of primaquine according to cumulative incidence of recurrences after 28 days was determined. The overall relative risk with fixed-effects meta-analysis was estimated. 
 
         
         
           Results: 
            For the regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/7 days were identified 7 studies, which showed an incidence of recurrence between 0% and 20% with follow-up 60-210 days; only 4 studies comparing with the standard regimen 0.25 mg/kg/day/14 days and no difference in recurrences between both regimens (RR= 0.977, 95% CI= 0.670 to 1.423) were found. 3 clinical trials using regimen 0.5 mg/kg/day/14 days with an incidence of recurrences between 1.8% and 18.0% during 330-365 days were identified; only one study comparing with the standard regimen (RR= 0.846, 95% CI= 0.484 to 1.477). High risk of bias and differences in handling of included studies were found. 
 
         
         
           Conclusion: 
            Available evidence is insufficient to determine whether currently PQ regimens used as alternative rather than standard treatment have better efficacy and safety in preventing relapse of  P. vivax . Clinical trials are required to guide changes in treatment regimen of malaria vivax.

          Plasmodium vivax  resistance to chloroquine (CQ) is currently reported in almost all countries where  P. vivax  is endemic. In Vietnam, despite a first report on  P. vivax  resistance to chloroquine published in the early 2000s,  P. vivax  was still considered sensitive to CQ. Between May 2009 and December 2011, a 2-year cohort study was conducted in central Vietnam to assess the recommended radical cure regimen based on a 10-day course of primaquine (0.5 mg/kg/day) together with 3 days of CQ (25 mg/kg). Here we report the results of the first 28-day follow-up estimating the cumulative risk of  P. vivax  recurrences together with the corresponding CQ blood concentrations, among other endpoints. Out of 260 recruited  P. vivax  patients, 240 completed treatment and were followed up to day 28 according to the WHO guidelines. Eight patients (3.45%) had a recurrent  P. vivax  infection, at day 14 ( n  = 2), day 21 ( n  = 1), and day 28 ( n  = 5). Chloroquine blood concentrations, available for 3/8 recurrent infections (days 14, 21, and 28), were above the MIC (&gt;100 ng/ml whole blood) in all of these cases. Fever and parasitemia (both sexual and asexual stages) were cleared by day 3. Anemia was common at day 0 (35.8%), especially in children under 10 years (50%), and hemoglobin (Hb) recovery at day 28 was substantial among anemic patients (median change from day 0 to 28, +1.7 g/dl; interquartile range [IQR], +0.7 to +3.2). This report, based on CQ blood levels measured at the time of recurrences, confirms for the first time  P. vivax  CQ resistance in central Vietnam and calls for further studies using standardized protocols for accurately monitoring the extent and evolution of  P. vivax  resistance to chloroquine in Vietnam. These results, together with the mounting evidence of artemisinin resistance in central Vietnam, further highlight the increasing threat of antimalarial drug resistance to malaria elimination in Vietnam.

           Background 
           In Mexico, combined chloroquine (CQ) and primaquine (PQ) treatment has been used since the late 1950s to treat  Plasmodium vivax  infections. Although malaria transmission has declined, current treatment strategies must be evaluated to advance towards malaria elimination. 
         
         
           Methods 
           The clinical and parasitological outcome of treating symptomatic  P. vivax  with the 14-day (T14) treatment or intermittent single dose (ISD) regimen was evaluated in southern Mexico between February 2008 and September 2010. Patients over 12 months old with  P. vivax  mono-infection and asexual parasitaemia ≥500 parasites/µl were treated under supervision. After diagnosis (day 0), treatment began immediately. T14 patients received CQ for 3 days (10, 10 and 5 mg/kg) and PQ daily for 14 days (0.25 mg/kg), while ISD patients received a single dose of CQ (10 mg/kg) and PQ (0.75 mg/kg) on days 0, 30, 60, 180, 210, and 240. Follow-up was done by observing clinical and laboratory (by microscopy, serology and PCR) outcome, considering two endpoints: primary blood infection clearance and clinical response at ~28 days, and the incidence of recurrent blood infection during 12 months. Parasite genotypes of primary/recurrent blood infections were analysed. 
         
         
           Results 
           During the first 28 days, no differences in parasite clearance or clinical outcome were observed between T14 (86 patients) and ISD (67 patients). On day 3, 95 % of patients in both groups showed no blood parasites, and no recurrences were detected on days 7–28. Contrarily, the therapeutic effectiveness (absence of recurrent parasitaemia) was distinct for T14 versus ISD at 12 months: 83.7 versus 50 %, respectively (p = 0.000). Symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were recorded on days 31–352. Some parasite recurrences were detected by PCR and/or serological testing. 
         
         
           Conclusions 
           T14 was effective for opportune elimination of the primary blood infection and preventing relapse episodes. The first single dose of CQ-PQ eliminated primary blood infection as efficiently as the initial three-dose scheme of T14, but the ISD regimen should be abandoned. A single combined dose administered to symptomatic patients in remote areas while awaiting parasitological diagnosis may contribute to halting  P. vivax  transmission. Alternatives for meeting the challenge of T14 supervision are discussed.

         Prevention of relapse of  Plasmodium vivax  infection is a key treatment goal in malaria. Use of  P. vivax  genotyping in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2b study in Peru, India, Thailand, and Brazil allowed determination of genetically heterologous or homologous  P. vivax  infection recurrence following receipt of chloroquine plus one of 4 doses of tafenoquine (50, 100, 300, or 600 mg) or chloroquine plus primaquine, compared with receipt of chloroquine alone. The antihypnozoite efficacy of tafenoquine was evident as a reduction in homologous recurrences of  P. vivax  infection as drug doses were increased. No clear dose-response pattern was evident for heterologous recurrences of  P. vivax  infection. Rates of homologous recurrence of  P. vivax  infection appear to be clinically useful for comparing drug efficacy for the prevention of  P. vivax  infection relapse.

           Background 
           Of late there have been accounts of therapeutic failure and chloroquine resistance in  Plasmodium vivax  malaria especially from Southeast Asian regions. The present study was conducted to assess the therapeutic efficacy of chloroquine–primaquine (CQ–PQ) combined regimen in a cohort of uncomplicated  P. vivax  mono-infection. 
         
         
           Methods 
           A tertiary care hospital-based prospective study was conducted among adult cohort with mono-infection  P. vivax  malaria as per the World Health Organization’s protocol of in vivo assessment of anti-malarial therapeutic efficacy. Participants were treated with CQ 25 mg/kg body weight divided over 3 days and PQ 0.25 mg/kg body weight daily for 2 weeks. 
         
         
           Results 
           Of a total of 125 participants recruited, 122 (97.6%) completed day 28 follow up, three (2.4%) participants were lost to follow-up. Eight patients (6.4%) were ascertained to have mixed  P. vivax  and  Plasmodium falciparum  infection by nested polymerase chain reaction test. The majority of subjects (56.8%, 71/125) became aparasitaemic on day 2 followed by 35.2% (44/125) on day 3, and 8% (10/125) on day 7, and remained so thereafter. Overall only one therapeutic failure (0.8%, 1/125) occurred on day 3 due to persistence of fever and parasitaemia. 
         
         
           Conclusions 
           CQ–PQ combined regimen remains outstandingly effective for uncomplicated  P. vivax  malaria and should be retained as treatment of choice in the study region. One case of treatment failure indicates possible resistance which warrants constant vigilance and periodic surveillance.

         The dynamics of  Plasmodium vivax  infection is characterized by reactivation of hypnozoites at varying time intervals. The relative contribution of new  P .  vivax  infection and reactivation of dormant liver stage hypnozoites to initiation of blood stage infection is unclear. In this study, we investigate the contribution of new inoculations of  P .  vivax  sporozoites to primary infection versus reactivation of hypnozoites by modeling the dynamics of  P .  vivax  infection in Thailand in patients receiving treatment for either blood stage infection alone (chloroquine), or the blood and liver stages of infection (chloroquine + primaquine). In addition, we also analysed rates of infection in a study in Papua New Guinea (PNG) where patients were treated with either artesunate, or artesunate + primaquine. Our results show that up to 96% of the  P .  vivax  infection is due to hypnozoite reactivation in individuals living in endemic areas in Thailand. Similar analysis revealed the around 70% of infections in the PNG cohort were due to hypnozoite reactivation. We show how the age of the cohort, primaquine drug failure, and seasonality may affect estimates of the ratio of primary  P .  vivax  infection to hypnozoite reactivation. Modeling of  P .  vivax  primary infection and hypnozoite reactivation provides important insights into infection dynamics, and suggests that 90–96% of blood stage infections arise from hypnozoite reactivation. Major differences in infection kinetics between Thailand and PNG suggest the likelihood of drug failure in PNG. 
        
         Author Summary 
          Plasmodium vivax  is one of two major parasite species causing human disease. This parasite can lie dormant in the liver as a hypnozoite, before later reactivating to cause blood-stage infection. Treatment to eliminate the dormant hypnozoite stage relies mostly on a single drug—primaquine. Understanding the rate of primary infection versus hypnozoite reactivation is important to understanding primaquine efficacy and drug resistance, as well as the development of new drugs targeting hypnozoites. Here we use mathematical modeling to analyse data from two clinical cohorts and show that up to 96% of infections may be caused by hypnozoite reactivation. We also use modeling to understand the impact of drug resistance, seasonal infection and subject age.

          Plasmodium vivax  is the most prevalent of the five species causing malaria in humans. The current available treatment for  P. vivax  malaria is limited and unsatisfactory due to at least two drawbacks: the undesirable side effects of primaquine (PQ) and drug resistance to chloroquine. Phenylalanine-alanine-PQ (Phe-Ala-PQ) is a PQ prodrug with a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile compared to PQ. The toxicity of this prodrug was evaluated in  in vitro  assays using a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2), a monkey kidney cell line (BGM), and human red blood cells deficient in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD). In addition,  in vivo  toxicity assays were performed with rats that received multiple doses of Phe-Ala-PQ to evaluate biochemical, hematological, and histopathological parameters. The activity was assessed by the inhibition of the sporogonic cycle using a chicken malaria parasite. Phe-Ala-PQ blocked malaria transmission in Aedes mosquitoes. When compared with PQ, it was less cytotoxic to BGM and HepG2 cells and caused less hemolysis of G6PD-deficient red blood cells at similar concentrations. The prodrug caused less alteration in the biochemical parameters than did PQ. Histopathological analysis of the liver and kidney did show differences between the control and Phe-Ala-PQ-treated groups, but they were not statistically significant. Taken together, the results highlight the prodrug as a novel lead compound candidate for the treatment of  P. vivax  malaria and as a blocker of malaria transmission.

         In the 1950s, the strategy of adding chloroquine to food salt as a prophylaxis
against malaria was considered to be a successful tool. However, with the development
of  Plasmodium  resistance in the Brazilian Amazon, this control
strategy was abandoned. More than 50 years later, asexual stage resistance can be
avoided by screening for antimalarial drugs that have a selective action against
gametocytes, thus old prophylactic measures can be revisited. The efficacy of the old
methods should be tested as complementary tools for the elimination of malaria.

           Background 
            Plasmodium vivax  is the main malaria parasite in China, and China is now making efforts to eliminate malaria by 2020. Radical cure of vivax malaria is one of challenges for malaria elimination. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemisinin-naphthoquine (ANQ) versus chloroquine-primaquine (CQ-PQ) in treatment of vivax malaria in Yunnan Province, China. 
         
         
           Methods 
           An open-label randomized and non-inferiority design, eligible patients with monoinfections of  P. vivax  were randomly assigned to receive either a total target dose of ANQ 24.5 mg/kg (naphthoquine 7 mg/kg and artemisinin 17.5 mg/kg), once a day for three days, or a total CQ dose of 24 mg base/kg, once a day for three days plus a PQ dose of 0.45 mg base/kg/day, once a day for eight days. Patients were followed up for one year. The difference in efficacy between ANQ and CQ-PQ was compared via Wilson’s test. 
         
         
           Results 
           By day 42, the number of patients free of recurrence was 125 (98.4%; 95% Confidence interval, 94.4-99.8%) for ANQ arm and 123 (96.1%; 95%CI, 91.1-98.7%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.4496). By day 365, the number was 101 (79.5%; 95%CI, 71.8-85.9%) for ANQ and 106 (82.8%; 95%CI, 75.1-88.9%) for CQ-PQ, and non-significant (P = 0.610). So the proportions of patients free of recurrence had no significant difference between ANQ and CQ-PQ groups by day 28, 42 and 365; compared with CQ-PQ, the side effect of ANQ was mild. 
         
         
           Conclusion 
           ANQ is non-inferior to CQ-PQ in terms of patients free of recurrence, and safer than CQ-PQ.

           Background 
            In vivo  efficacy assessments of antimalarials are essential for ensuring effective case management. In Ethiopia, chloroquine (CQ) without primaquine is the first-line treatment for  Plasmodium vivax  in malarious areas, but artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is also commonly used. 
         
         
           Methods and Findings 
           In 2009, we conducted a 42-day efficacy study of AL or CQ for  P. vivax  in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Individuals with  P. vivax  monoinfection were enrolled. Primary endpoint was day 28 cure rate. In patients with recurrent parasitemia, drug level and genotyping using microsatellite markers were assessed. Using survival analysis, uncorrected patient cure rates at day 28 were 75.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 66.8–82.5) for AL and 90.8% (95% CI 83.6–94.9) for CQ. During the 42 days of follow-up, 41.6% (47/113) of patients in the AL arm and 31.8% (34/107) in the CQ arm presented with recurrent  P. vivax  infection, with the median number of days to recurrence of 28 compared to 35 days in the AL and CQ arm, respectively. Using microsatellite markers to reclassify recurrent parasitemias with a different genotype as non-treatment failures, day 28 cure rates were genotype adjusted to 91.1% (95% CI 84.1–95.1) for AL and to 97.2% (91.6–99.1) for CQ. Three patients (2.8%) with recurrent parasitemia by day 28 in the CQ arm were noted to have drug levels above 100 ng/ml. 
         
         
           Conclusions 
           In the short term, both AL and CQ were effective and well-tolerated for  P. vivax  malaria, but high rates of recurrent parasitemia were noted with both drugs. CQ provided longer post-treatment prophylaxis than AL, resulting in delayed recurrence of parasitemia. Although the current policy of species-specific treatment can be maintained for Ethiopia, the co-administration of primaquine for treatment of  P. vivax  malaria needs to be urgently considered to prevent relapse infections.

         Patients with  Plasmodium vivax  malaria are treated with primaquine to prevent relapse infections. We report primaquine failure in a patient with 3 relapses without any possibility of re-infection. Using whole genome sequencing of the relapsing parasite isolates, we identified single nucleotide variants as candidate molecular markers of resistance.

           Background 
           The  Plasmodium vivax  that was once prevalent in temperate climatic zones typically had an interval between primary infection and first relapse of 7–10 months, whereas in tropical areas  P.vivax  infections relapse frequently at intervals of 3–6 weeks. Defining the epidemiology of these two phenotypes from temporal patterns of illness in endemic areas is difficult or impossible, particularly if they overlap. 
         
         
           Methods 
           A prospective open label comparison of chloroquine (CQ) alone versus CQ plus unobserved primaquine for either 5 days or 14 days was conducted in patients presenting with acute vivax malaria in Kolkata. Patients were followed for 15 months and primary and recurrent infections were genotyped using three polymorphic antigen and up to 8 microsatellite markers. 
         
         
           Results 
           151 patients were enrolled of whom 47 (31%) had subsequent recurrent infections. Recurrence proportions were similar in the three treatment groups. Parasite genotyping revealed discrete temporal patterns of recurrence allowing differentiation of probable relapse from newly acquired infections. This suggested that 32 of the 47 recurrences were probable relapses of which 22 (69%) were genetically homologous. The majority (81%) of probable relapses occurred within three months (16 homologous, 10 heterologous) and six genetically homologous relapses (19%) were of the long latency (8–10 month interval) phenotype. 
         
         
           Conclusions 
           With long follow-up to assess temporal patterns of vivax malaria recurrence, genotyping of  P.vivax  can be used to assess relapse rates. A 14 day unobserved course of primaquine did not prevent relapse. Genotyping indicates that long latency  P.vivax  is prevalent in West Bengal, and that the first relapses after long latent periods are genetically homologous.

           Background 
           In Honduras, chloroquine and primaquine are recommended and still appear to be effective for treatment of  Plasmodium falciparum  and  Plasmodium vivax  malaria. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of resistance associated genetic polymorphisms in  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax  collected in Honduras. 
         
         
           Methods 
           Blood samples were collected from patients seeking medical attention at the Hospital Escuela in Tegucigalpa from 2004 to 2006 as well as three regional hospitals, two health centres and one regional laboratory during 2009. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in  P. falciparum  chloroquine resistance transporter ( pfcrt ), multidrug resistance 1 ( pfmdr1 ), dihydrofolate reductase ( pfdhfr ) and dihydropteroate synthase ( pfdhps ) genes and in  P. vivax  multidrug resistance 1 ( pvmdr1 ) and dihydrofolate reductase ( pvdhfr ) genes were detected using PCR based methods. 
         
         
           Results 
           Thirty seven  P. falciparum  and 64  P. vivax  samples were collected. All  P. falciparum  infections acquired in Honduras carried  pfcrt ,  pfmdr1, pfdhps  and  pfdhfr  alleles associated with chloroquine, amodiaquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine sensitivity only. One patient with parasites acquired on a Pacific Island had  pfcrt  76 T and  pfmdr1  86Y alleles. That patient and a patient infected in West Africa had  pfdhfr  51I, 59 R and 108 N alleles.  Pvmdr1  976 F was found in 7/37 and two copies of  pvmdr1  were found in 1/37 samples.  Pvdhfr  57 L + 58 R was observed in 2/57 samples. 
         
         
           Conclusion 
           The results indicate that  P. falciparum  from Honduras remain sensitive to chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. This suggests that chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine should be efficacious for treatment of uncomplicated  P. falciparum  malaria, supporting current national treatment guidelines. However, genetic polymorphisms associated with chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine tolerance were detected in local  P. vivax  and imported  P. falciparum  infections. Continuous monitoring of the prevalence of drug resistant/tolerant  P. falciparum  and  P. vivax  is therefore essential also in Honduras.

         Primaquine was officially licensed as an anti-malarial drug by the FDA in 1952. It has remained the only FDA licensed drug capable of clearing the intra-hepatic schizonts and hypnozoites of  Plasmodium vivax . This update and review focuses on five major aspects of primaquine use in treatment of vivax malaria, namely: a) evidence of efficacy of primaquine for its current indications; b) potential hazards of its widespread use, c) critical analysis of reported resistance against primaquine containing regimens; d) evidence for combining primaquine with artemisinins in areas of chloroquine resistance; and e) the potential for replacement of primaquine with newer drugs.

           Background 
           In Thailand, the proportion of  Plasmodium vivax  infection has become equal to  Plasmodium falciparum . Reports of a trend of gradual decline of  in vitro  sensitivity of  P. vivax  to chloroquine in some areas of the country, together with accumulating evidences of chloroquine resistance  P. vivax  in other parts of the world, emphasize the need for closely and continuously monitoring clinical efficacy in conjunction with  in vitro  sensitivity of  P. vivax  isolates. 
         
         
           Methods 
           The study was conducted at Mae Tao clinic for migrant workers, Tak Province during March 2008 - August 2009. A total of 130 patients (17 Thais and 113 Burmeses; 64 males and 66 females) with mono-infection of  P. vivax  malaria, aged between 15-60 years and weighing more than 40 kg, were included in the study. Patients received treatment with chloroquine (2,000 mg chloroquine phosphate over three days) and the anti-relapse drug primaquine (15 mg for 14 days).  In vitro  sensitivity of  P. vivax  isolates was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay. 
         
         
           Results 
           All patients showed satisfactory response to treatment. The cure rate was virtually 100% within the follow-up period of 42 days. Neither recurrence of  P. vivax  parasitaemia nor appearance of  P. falciparum  occurred during the investigation period.  In vitro  data showed a stable sensitivity of chloroquine in this area since 2006. Geometric mean and median (95% CI) values of IC 50  for chloroquine were 100.1 and 134.7 (1.1-264.9) nM, respectively. 
         
         
           Conclusion 
            In vivo  results suggest that the standard regimen of chloroquine was still very effective for the treatment of blood infections with  P. vivax  in the Thai-Myanmar border area.  In vitro  sensitivity data however, raise the possibility of potential advent of resistance in the future. Regular monitoring of the chloroquine sensitivity of  P. vivax  is essential to facilitate the early recognition of treatment failures and to expedite the formulation of appropriate changes to the drug policy.

         In Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale malaria, some of the liver stage parasites remain dormant. The activation of these dormant forms (called hypnozoite) can give rise to relapse weeks, months or years after the initial infection. 
         To prevent relapses, a course of primaquine may be given as terminal prophylaxis to patients. Different strains of Plasmodium vivax vary in their sensitivity to primaquine and, recently, cases of relapse of Plasmodium vivax after this standard primaquine therapy were reported from various countries. 
         We reported a case of primaquine resistant malaria which initially was thought to be relapsed caused by loss of terminal prophylaxis.
